CODSOFT-
Welcome to my Artificial Internship Portfolio! In this repository, you will find a collection of projects that I have completed during my internship at Codsoft. Each project showcases my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving. Below is a summary of the projects:


1.CHATBOT
A simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on
predefined rules. Using if-else statements or pattern matching
techniques we  can identify user queries and provide appropriate
responses. This will give you a basic understanding of natural
language processing and conversation flow.


2.FACE DETECTION
An AI application that can detect and recognize faces in
images or videos. UsING pre-trained face detection models like Haar
cascades or deep learning-based face detectors, and optionally
add face recognition capabilities using techniques like Siamese
networks or ArcFace.


3.RECOMMENDATION
CreatING a simple recommendation system that suggests items to
users based on their preferences. By using techniques like
collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to recommend
movies, books, or products to users.
